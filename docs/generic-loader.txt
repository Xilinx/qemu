The 'loader' device allows the user to load multiple images or values into
QEMU at startup.

Loading Memory Values
---------------------
The loader device allows memory values to be set from the command line. This
can be done by following the syntax below:

    -device loader,addr=<addr>,data=<data>,data-len=<len>
    -device loader,addr=<addr>,cpu-num=<cpu-num>

    <addr>      - The address to store the data or the value to use as the
                  CPU's PC.
    <data>      - The value to be written to the address. The maximum size of
                  the data is 8 bytes.
    <data-len>  - The length of the data in bytes. This argument must be
                  included if the data argument is.
    <data-be>   - Set to true if the data to be stored on the guest should be
                  written as big endian data. The default is to write little
                  endian data.
    <cpu-num>   - This will cause the CPU to be reset and the PC to be set to
                  the value of addr.

For all values both hex and decimal values are allowed. By default the values
will be parsed as decimal. To use hex values the user should prefix the number
with a '0x'.

An example of loading value 0x8000000e to address 0xfd1a0104 is:
    -device loader,addr=0xfd1a0104,data=0x8000000e,data-len=4

Loading Files
-------------
The loader device also allows files to be loaded into memory. This can be done
similarly to setting memory values. The syntax is shown below:

    -device loader,file=<file>,addr=<addr>,cpu-num=<cpu-num>,force-raw=<raw>

    <file>      - A file to be loaded into memory
    <addr>      - The addr in memory that the file should be loaded. This is
                  ignored if you are using an ELF (unless force-raw is true).
                  This is required if you aren't loading an ELF.
    <cpu-num>   - This specifies the CPU that should be used. This is an
                  optional argument and will cause the CPU's PC to be set to
                  where the image is stored or in the case of an ELF file to
                  the value in the header. This option should only be used
                  for the boot image.
                  This will also cause the image to be written to the specified
                  CPUs address space.
    <force-raw> - Forces the file to be treated as a raw image. This can be
                  used to specify the load address of ELF files.

For all values both hex and decimal values are allowed. By default the values
will be parsed as decimal. To use hex values the user should prefix the number
with a '0x'.

An example of loading an ELF file which CPU0 will boot is shown below:
    -device loader,file=./images/boot.elf,cpu-num=0
